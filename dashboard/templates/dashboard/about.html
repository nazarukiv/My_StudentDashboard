    <h1>👋 Hi, I'm Ivan</h1>
    <p>A curious student navigating tech, life, learning.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>📍 Where It Started</h2>
    <p>I began my journey into programming at a small computer academy in Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine. That early exposure planted something big: a love for structure, logic, and solving puzzles. Since then, I've moved countries, shifted contexts, and kept the code flowing.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>🎓 What I'm Doing Now</h2>
    <p>I’m currently studying Level 3 ICT at West London College, where I’ve built up real technical and problem-solving skills, from backend development to project management. I’ve earned certifications in algorithms, Python, FastAPI, Docker, SQL and more. My path is hands-on, project-based, and always in motion.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>📐 Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>I built this project because I love tracking things. Tasks, progress, goals: all of it. This dashboard reflects how I live: intentional, methodical, curious. It’s not just a portfolio, I use this every day to stay focused and structured.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>🔍 My Approach</h2>
    <p>I’m a big fan of precision. I read books, analyze films, track events. I build tools that help me stay clear-headed. I explore trading and investing, aiming for financial literacy while deepening my mindset in tech. I also value aesthetics and design, how something looks is how it makes you feel.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>💼 Experience Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>📬 Digital Ambassador @ West London College (Newsletter and content strategy)</li>
        <li>🍝 Waiter at Rossopomodoro UK — learning soft skills, working under pressure</li>
        <li>🧑‍💼 Received 3 professional recommendations — praised for creativity, detail, communication</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>🛠️ Tools I Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Django + Bootstrap for this app</li>
        <li>FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Git</li>
        <li>VSCode, Linux terminal, Markdown notes</li>
        <li>Python (obviously), some JavaScript, and a growing interest in AI</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>📫 Contact Me</h2>
    <p>If you’re a recruiter, developer, mentor — or just curious — feel free to reach out. I’m actively learning and always open to collaborate, intern, or grow in new ways.</p>
    <p>This project is just a scratchpad for something bigger. But I’m proud of how far I’ve already come.</p>
